3/10/17, 4:08 AM - Ahmed White Pakturk: Well Mk what's important is a relative term. For a monkey its imp to climb a tree nd for a bird is to learn to fly similarly one mans objectives can be to go the moon but for the other ot can be make a better place on earth. Both feild require different qualities and education but students of both feild r treated same in school nd colleges
3/10/17, 12:55 PM - Ahmed White Pakturk: the current education system has it pros nd cons but still i think its a gud system overall cuz everyone is taught the basic of everything so that when u choose ur future ideal profession all doors r open
3/10/17, 12:55 PM - Ahmed White Pakturk: well i agree with u there ali
3/10/17, 12:57 PM - Ahmed White Pakturk: no student in middle school knows exactly what they want to be so all doors should be kept open with basic knowledge of everything
3/10/17, 4:06 PM - Ahmed White Pakturk: Mk osamas point was that we could make a more efficient education system by polishing those qualities of a kid in which he is gud at to make a more efficient professional in future
3/10/17, 4:06 PM - Ahmed White Pakturk: with that said it ain't possible cuz 90% kids dont know what they r gud at
3/10/17, 4:07 PM - Ahmed White Pakturk: but for 10% it is possible nd a alternate system should be available for those students
3/10/17, 11:20 PM - Ahmed White Pakturk: osama why do u consider debate a negative thing its a positive process it provokes ur mind to think no be lazy nd sleep all day
